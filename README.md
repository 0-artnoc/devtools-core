### Object Inspector

Object Inspector is component responsible for creating the property tree.

In the scopes pane, it receives a set of scopes as the roots. But it is recursive, and subsequent levels it shows property nodes.

* *getObjectProperties* - it expects a way to get loaded properties
* *loadObjectProperties* - it expects a way to fetch new properties

```js
ObjectInspector({
  roots: scopes,
  getObjectProperties: id => loadedObjects.get(id),
  loadObjectProperties
});
```
